### Hi there, I'm Rusheb!

I'm an ex-Amazon software engineer, currently upskilling on ML engineering and Large Language Models.

Current projects:
- I'm participating in the [Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator (ARENA) 2.0](https://arena.education)
- I'm an active contributor to the mechanistic interpretability library [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens). Most notably, I [added support for BERT](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/transformerlens/pull/276) to the library.

Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate!

Stuff to put in here:
- 🐭🧀 my [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp) project, Understanding Search in Transformers, where we are applying interpretability techniques to [maze-solving transformers](https://github.com/aisc-understanding-search/maze-transformer).
- 🤖🔍 [neelnanda-io/TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), an open-source library for doing interpretability research on transformers.
