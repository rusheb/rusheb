### Hi there, I'm Rusheb!

I'm an ex-Amazon software engineer working on machine learning interpretability research. I'm currently spending most of my time on 

- 🐭🧀 my [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp) project, Understanding Search in Transformers, where we are applying interpretability techniques to [maze-solving transformers](https://github.com/aisc-understanding-search/maze-transformer).
- 🤖🔍 [neelnanda-io/TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), an open-source library for doing interpretability research on transformers.

Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate!
